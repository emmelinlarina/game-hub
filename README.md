#### Javascript 1 Course Assignment

An interactive online game store built as my **JavaScript Course Assignment** at Noroff.  
The site fetches products dynamically from the **Noroff GameHub API**, allowing users to browse, filter, and purchase games.

## About the Project

The goal was to replace hardcoded product data with a fully functional API-driven store and practice core JavaScript skills:

- Fetching and displaying data from an API
- Creating reusable modules and utility functions
- Managing cart state across multiple pages with **localStorage**
- Building dynamic UI interactions with **vanilla JavaScript**

**Pages implemented:**

1. Homepage (bestselling products)
2. Products page with filtering & sorting
3. Single product page with dynamic details
4. Checkout page (cart summary + totals)
5. Checkout success/confirmation page
6. About us
7. Contact us
